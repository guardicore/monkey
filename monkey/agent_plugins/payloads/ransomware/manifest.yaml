description: >-
  Simulates a ransomware attack on your network using a set of configurable behaviors.

  To simulate ransomware encryption, you'll need to provide Infection Monkey
  with files that it can safely encrypt. Create a directory with some files on each
  machine where the ransomware simulation will run. No files will be encrypted
  if a directory is not specified or if the specified directory doesn't exist on a
  victim machine.

  Optionally, a README.txt file can be left in the specified target directory.
