description: >-
  Simulates a data exfiltration attack on your network using a set of configurable behaviours.

  To simulate data exfiltration, you'll need to provide Infection Monkey
  with files or enable data generation that it can safely exfiltrate. Create a directory with
  some files on each machine where the data exfiltration will run. No files will be exfiltrated
  if a directory is not specified or doesn't exists, or if data generation is disabled in options.

  Also define a data exfiltration mechanism which will be used when the payload runs.
  The payload will use that mechanism to exfiltrate the data.
