title: Hadoop/YARN Exploiter
version: 3.0.0
description: >-
  Remote code execution on Hadoop server with YARN and default settings.

  Logic based on [POC in vulnhub](https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub/tree/master/hadoop/unauthorized-yarn).
safe: true
remediation_suggestion: >-
    Run Hadoop in secure mode ([add Kerberos authentication](
    http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SecureMode.html)).

    The server is vulnerable to a remote code execution attack.
    This attack was possible due to the default Hadoop/YARN configuration being insecure.
