# Building Java class templates for log4shell

## Summary
The log4shell exploiter provides two files, `LinuxExploit.class.template` and
`WindowsExploit.class.templete`. These files are served to a vulnerable machine
via LDAP and HTTP to achieve remote code execution. This README file contains
instructions for rebuilding these template files should it ever become
necessary.

## Proceedure

1. Copy the desired Linux or Windows Java source code to a new file named
   `Exploit.java`. Both Java source code files contain a class named `Exploit`.
   When building Java classes, the class name and the file name must match
   exactly.

   ```
   $ cp LinuxExploit.java Exploit.java
   ```

1. Use `javac` to build the Java class file.
   ```
   $ javac Exploit.java
   ```

1. Rename the `.class` file with the appropriate OS name.
   ```
   $ mv Exploit.class LinuxExploit.class.template
   ```

1. Remove the `Exploit.java` file, as it is no longer needed.
