    The machine is vulnerable to an attack on Net-SNMP via
    [CVE-2020-15862](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15862)
    An Infection Monkey Agent executed a command over SNMP using
    stolen/configured credentials or community strings. This attack was
    possible because the version of Net-SNMP running on the server has not had
    security patches applied.
