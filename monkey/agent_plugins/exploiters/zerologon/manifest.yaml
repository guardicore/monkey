title: Zerologon Exploiter
version: 2.0.0
description: >-
    Exploits a privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472) in a Windows
    server domain controller (DC) by using the Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC).
    This exploiter changes the password of a Windows server DC account, steals
    credentials, and then attempts to restore the original DC password. The
    victim DC will be unable to communicate with other DCs until the original
    password has been restored. If Infection Monkey fails to restore the
    password automatically, you'll have to do it manually. For more
    information, see the documentation.
safe: false

    The machine is vulnerable to a Zerologon exploit.
    This attack was possible because the latest security updates from Microsoft
    have not been applied to this machine. For more information about this vulnerability,
