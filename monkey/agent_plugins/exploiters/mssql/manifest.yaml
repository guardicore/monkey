title: MSSQL Exploiter
version: 1.1.0
description: >-
    Attempts a brute-force attack against Microsoft SQL using known credentials
    and takes advantage of insecure configuration to execute commands on the
    server.
safe: true
remediation_suggestion: >-
    Disable the `xp_cmdshell` option.

    The machine is vulnerable to an MSSQL exploit.
    This attack was possible because the target machine used an outdated MSSQL
    server configuration, allowing the usage of the `xp_cmdshell` command. To
    learn more about how to disable this feature, read
    [Microsoft's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/xp-cmdshell-server-configuration-option?view=sql-server-2017).
