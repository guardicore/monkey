description: >-
    Exploits PowerShell remote execution setups. PowerShell Remoting uses
    Windows Remote Management (WinRM) to allow users to run PowerShell commands
    on remote computers.
safe: true
remediation_suggestion: >-
    Restrict PowerShell remote command execution and/or harden the credentials of relevant users.

    The machine is vulnerable to a PowerShell Remoting attack.
    This attack was possible because the target machine had PowerShell Remoting enabled
    and Infection Monkey had access to correct credentials.
