What is Guardicore Infection Monkey?
====================================

The Infection Monkey is an open-source breach and attack simulation tool for testing a data center's resiliency to perimeter breaches and internal server infection.
Infection Monkey will help you validate existing security solutions and will provide a view of the internal network from an attacker's perspective.

Infection Monkey is free and can be downloaded from hyperlink: `our homepage <https://infectionmonkey.com/>`_.

How it works
============

Architecturally, Infection Monkey is comprised of two components:

* Monkey Agent (Monkey for short) - a safe, worm-like binary program which scans, propagates and simulates attack techniques on the **local network**.
* Monkey Island Server (Island for short) - a C&C web server which provides a GUI for users and interacts with the Monkey Agents.

The user can run the Monkey Agent on the Island server machine or distribute Monkey Agent binaries on the network manually. Based on
the configuration parameters, Monkey Agents scan, propagate and simulate an attacker's behavior on the local network. All of the
information gathered about the network is aggregated in the Island Server and displayed once all Monkey Agents are finished.


Results
=======

The results of running Monkey Agents are:
 - A map which displays how much of the network an attacker can see, what services are accessible and potential propagation routes.
 - A security report, which displays security issues that Monkey Agents discovered and/or exploited.
 - A MITRE ATT&CK report, which displays the information about the ATT&CK techniques that Monkey Agents tried to use.
 - A Zero Trust report, which displays violations of Zero Trust principles that Monkey Agents found.

..
  A more in-depth description of reports generated can be found in the [reports documentation page]({{< ref "/reports" >}}).
