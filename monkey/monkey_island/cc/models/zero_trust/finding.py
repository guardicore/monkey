    """
    This model represents a Zero-Trust finding: A result of a test the monkey/island might
    perform to see if a
    specific principle of zero trust is upheld or broken.

    Findings might have the following statuses:
        Failed ❌
            Meaning that we are sure that something is wrong (example: segmentation issue).
        Verify ⁉
            Meaning that we need the user to check something himself (example: 2FA logs,
            AV missing).
        Passed ✔
            Meaning that we are sure that something is correct (example: Monkey failed exploiting).

    This class has 2 main section:
        *   The schema section defines the DB fields in the document. This is the data of the
        object.
        *   The logic section defines complex questions we can ask about a single document which
        are asked multiple
            times, or complex action we will perform - somewhat like an API.
