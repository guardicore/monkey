    Interface for running commands on a remote machine

    Since these classes are a bit complex, I provide a list of common terminology and formats:
    * command line - a command line. e.g. 'echo hello'
    * command - represent a single command which was already run. Always of type Cmd
    * command id - any unique identifier of a command which was already run
    * command result - represents the result of running a command. Always of type CmdResult
    * command status - represents the current status of a command. Always of type CmdStatus
    * command info - Any consistent structure representing additional information of a command which was already run
    * instance - a machine that commands will be run on. Can be any dictionary with 'instance_id' as a field
    * instance_id - any unique identifier of an instance (machine). Can be of any format
