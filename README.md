## Data center Security Testing Tool

Welcome to the Infection Monkey! 

The Infection Monkey is an open source security tool for testing a data center's resiliency to perimeter breaches and internal server infection. The Monkey uses various methods to self propagate across a data center and reports success to a centralized Monkey Island server.

The Infection Monkey is comprised of two parts:

* **Monkey** - A tool which infects other machines and propagates to them.
* **Monkey Island** - A dedicated server to control and visualize the Infection Monkey's progress inside the data center.
