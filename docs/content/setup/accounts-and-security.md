## Security in the Infection Monkey

The first time you launch Monkey Island (the Infection Monkey C&C server), you'll be prompted to create an account and secure your Island. After account creation, the server will only be accessible via the credentials you entered.

## Resetting your account credentials

This procedure is documented in [the FAQ](doc:frequently-asked-questions).
