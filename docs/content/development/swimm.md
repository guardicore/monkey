The Monkey has development tutorials that use [`swimm.io`](https://swimm.io/) to help teach new developers how to perform common code tasks in the Monkey codebase and help the ramp-up process. The tutorial include adding new configuration values, new system info collectors, and more.

# How to start learning

First, [sign up for swimm's beta](https://swimm.io/sign-beta). `swimm` is free for open-source projects, but as they're still in beta, you need to sign up in order to download it.

After you've downloaded and installed `swimm`, open a shell in the Monkey repo folder and run:

```shell script
swimm start
``` 

A local web server with the currently available tutorials should show up, and look something like this:

Choose which playlist you'd like to learn, click on it, and follow the instructions.
