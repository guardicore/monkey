## What does this guide cover?

This guide will show you how to add a new _Exploit_ to the Infection Monkey.

An exploit is a sequence of commands that takes advantage of a security vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to a system on your network. If successful, an Infection Monkey agent is released on the exploited system. The result of an attempted exploit is sent back to the Monkey Island as an event.

### Do I need a new Exploit?

If you have your eye on an interesting CVE that you would like the Infection Monkey to support, you must add a new exploit. Keep reading to learn how to add a new exploit.


## How to add a new Exploit

### Modify the Infection Monkey Agent

The Infection Monkey exploiters are all built in a similar way. Each exploiter class inherits from the [`HostExploiter`](https://github.com/guardicore/monkey/blob/develop/monkey/infection_monkey/exploit/HostExploiter.py) class, which exposes two interface functions:

* `is_os_supported` - Returns a boolean value denoting whether the victim machine is supported by the exploiter (for example, returns `False` on Windows victim machines for the `SSHExploiter`). This can be used to thoroughly inspect a potential victim machine and decide whether to attempt the exploit on that particular machine (for example, by checking for open services matching specific versions).
* `exploit_host` - Exploits the host and returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the exploit was successful.

#### Adding a new exploiter

In the [Infection Monkey's exploit directory](https://github.com/guardicore/monkey/tree/develop/monkey/infection_monkey/exploit), add the **exploit's logic** by defining a new class that inherits from [`HostExploiter`](https://github.com/guardicore/monkey/blob/develop/monkey/infection_monkey/exploit/HostExploiter.py). If your new exploit is a web RCE (remote code execution) exploit, inherit from [`WebRCE`](https://github.com/guardicore/monkey/blob/develop/monkey/infection_monkey/exploit/web_rce.py).

```py
from infection_monkey.exploit.HostExploiter import HostExploiter

class MyNewExploiter(HostExploiter):
    ...
```

A good example of an exploiter class is the [`SSHExploiter`](https://github.com/guardicore/monkey/blob/develop/monkey/infection_monkey/exploit/sshexec.py). The [Log4Shell exploiter is a recently added web RCE exploit](https://github.com/guardicore/monkey/pull/1670) that is a good reference as well.


### Modify the Monkey Island

#### Configuration

1. Add your **exploiter's description** to the [configuration schema](https://github.com/guardicore/monkey/blob/develop/monkey/monkey_island/cc/services/config_schema/definitions/exploiter_classes.py).

```py
...
    {
        "type": "string",
        "enum": ["SMBExploiter"],
        "title": "SMB Exploiter",
        "safe": True,
        "info": "Brute forces using credentials provided by user and hashes gathered by mimikatz.",
        "link": "https://techdocs.akamai.com/infection-monkey/docs/smbexec/",
    },
    {
        "type": "string",                                                           <=================================
        "enum": ["MyNewExploiter"],                                                 <=================================
        "title": "My New Exploiter",                                                <=================================
        "safe": True,                                                               <=================================
        "info": "Information about your new exploiter.",                            <=================================
        "link": "Link to the documentation page explaining your new exploiter.",    <=================================
    },
...
```

2. Update the default **list of exploiters** in the [configuration schema](https://github.com/guardicore/monkey/blob/develop/monkey/monkey_island/cc/services/config_schema/basic.py) by adding your new exploiter's class name.

```py
...
    "exploiter_classes": {
        "title": "Exploiters",
        "type": "array",
        "uniqueItems": True,
        "items": {"$ref": "#/definitions/exploiter_classes"},
        "default": [
            "SMBExploiter",
            ...
            "Log4ShellExploiter",
            "MyNewExploiter",    <=================================
        ],
    }
...
```

#### Reporting

1. In the [report generation pipeline](https://github.com/guardicore/monkey/blob/develop/monkey/monkey_island/cc/services/reporting/issue_processing/exploit_processing/exploiter_descriptor_enum.py), define how your **exploiter** should be displayed in the report.

```py
class ExploiterDescriptorEnum(Enum):
    SMB = ExploiterDescriptor("SMBExploiter", "SMB Exploiter")
    ...
    ZEROLOGON = ExploiterDescriptor("ZerologonExploiter", "Zerologon Exploiter")
    MYNEWEXPLOITER = ExploitDescriptor("MyNewExploiter", "My New Exploiter")    <=================================
```

2. Describe how the Monkey Island should **display your exploiter's results** by defining the UI contents in the [security report](https://github.com/guardicore/monkey/blob/develop/monkey/monkey_island/cc/ui/src/components/report-components/SecurityReport.js).


### Documentation

**Update the documentation** to explain what your exploiter does in the [documentation framework](https://github.com/guardicore/monkey/blob/develop/docs/content/reference/exploiters/).
