The `/docs` folder contains the Infection Monkey Documentation site.

The site is based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [learn](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-theme-learn/en) theme.
The Hugo version being used is 0.92.0.

## Directory structure

By order of importance:

### Content

The most important directory is `/content`. This is the directory which contains the content files. [Read this to understand how pages are organized in that folder](https://themes.gohugo.io//theme/hugo-theme-learn/en/cont/pages/).

### Static

In this directory you should place images, `css` files, `js` files and other static content the site should serve. To access that static content in a page, use something similar to this:

```markdown
![AWS instance ID](../../images/setup/aws/aws-instance-id.png "AWS instance ID")
```

### Config

This folder controls many of the parameters regarding the site generation.

### Themes

This is the theme we're using. It's a submodule (to get it you need to run `git submodule update`). It's our own fork of the [learn](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-learn/) theme. If you want to make changes to the theme itself, or pull updates from the upstream, you'll do it here.

### Layouts and archtypes

This directory includes custom [HTML partials](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/), custom [shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) and content templates. It's best not to mess with the existing stuff here too much, but rather add new things.

### Public and resources

These are the build output of `hugo` and should never be `commit`-ed to git.

## How to contribute

### Requirements

You'll have to [install `hugo`](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/), a text editor that's good for markdown (`vscode` and `vim` are good options) and `git`.

Note: Installing `hugo` via `apt` is not recommended because Hugo is usually few [versions behind](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-modules/issues/703) the latest for Debian and Ubuntu package managers. Refer to latest [releases](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) of Hugo.

### Adding and editing content

#### Add a new page

Run `hugo new folder/page.md`. Optionally add `--kind chapter` if creating a new chapter page. For example, `hugo new usage/getting-started.md` created the Getting Started page.

#### Editing an existing page

Edit the markdown file(s). [Here's a markdown cheatsheet](https://themes.gohugo.io//theme/hugo-theme-learn/en/cont/markdown/). If you want to add images, add them to the `static/images` folder and refer to them by name.

### Building the content

#### Serve the documentation locally

Run `hugo server -D`. The server will be available locally at `http://localhost:1313/`. You can change the content/theme and the site will refresh automatically to reflect your changes.

#### Build the content for deployment

Run `hugo --environment staging` or `hugo --environment production`. This will create a static site in the `public` directory. This directory should be ignored by `git` - **make sure you don't add and commit it by mistake!**

#### Troubleshooting

##### `Error: Unable to locate config file or config directory. Perhaps you need to create a new site.`

Did you confirm your working directory? It should be `monkey/docs`.

##### `failed to extract shortcode: template for shortcode "children" not found` or theme doesn't seem right?

Have you run `git submodule update`?

##### CSS is missing

- Make sure that you're accessing the correct URL.
- Check the `config.toml` file.
