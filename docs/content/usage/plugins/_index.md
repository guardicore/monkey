## Overview

The Infection Monkey is extensible! You can install plugins to enhance the functionality of the Infection Monkey.

Plugins page consists of three tabs:

- **Available Plugins** - A table of plugins that are available for download and installation.
- **Installed Plugins** - A table of plugins that are currently installed on the Monkey Island.
- **Upload New Plugin** - A form to upload a new plugin to the Monkey Island. This is useful if you
 want to install a plugin that is not officially released yet.

## Troubleshooting

First, make sure that the machine running Monkey Island has access to the internet. If it does,
check the [Island logs]({{< ref "/FAQ/#monkey-island-server-logs" >}}).
