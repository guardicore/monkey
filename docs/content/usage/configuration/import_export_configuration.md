## Export configuration

You can export the current configuration by clicking the **Export** button at
the bottom of the configuration page. This will save the configuration to a
file, which you can later import. The configuration file can contain plaintext
or encrypted data. If your configuration contains any sensitive data, such as
usernames and passwords, you can choose a password during export that will be
used to encrypt the file.

{{% notice warning %}}
Make sure that you don't lose your password. The data in encrypted
configuration files cannot be recovered if password is lost.

## Import configuration

You can import a configuration file by clicking the **Import** button at the
bottom of the configuration page. If the configuration file is encrypted you
will be prompted to enter the password.

{{% notice note %}}
Configuration files that were exported from older versions of Infection Monkey
cannot necessarily be imported into newer versions.

If a configuration file enables plugins (e.g. exploiters or payloads) that are
not installed, the Monkey Island will refuse to import it. You can install
plugins on the [plugin installation page](/usage/plugins/).
