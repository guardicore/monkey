description: "Configure settings related to the Monkey's network activity."

Here you can control multiple important settings, such as:

* Network propagation depth - How many hops from the base machine will the Infection Monkey spread?
* Scan Agent's networks - Should the Infection Monkey attempt to attack any machine in its subnet?

  _Be careful when using this option. If a machine is connected to a public network, then the agent will scan the public network!_
* Scanner IP/subnet list - Which specific IP ranges should the Infection Monkey try to attack?
