Here you can control multiple important settings, such as:

* Network propagation depth - How many hops from the base machine will the Monkey spread
* Local network scan - Should the Monkey attempt to attack any machine in its subnet
* Scanner IP/subnet list - Specific IP ranges that the Monkey should try to attack.
