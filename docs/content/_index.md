## What is Guardicore Infection Monkey?

The Infection Monkey is an open-source breach and attack simulation tool for testing a data center's resiliency to perimeter breaches and internal server infection.
Infection Monkey will help you validate existing security solutions and provide a view of the internal network from an attacker's perspective.

Infection Monkey is free and can be downloaded from [our homepage](https://www.akamai.com/infectionmonkey).

## How it works

Architecturally, Infection Monkey is comprised of two components:

* Monkey Agent (Monkey for short) - a safe, worm-like binary program that scans, propagates and simulates attack techniques on the **local network**.
* Monkey Island Server (Island for short) - a C&C web server that provides a GUI for users and interacts with the Monkey Agents.

The user can run the Monkey Agent on the Island server machine or distribute Monkey Agent binaries on the network manually. Based on
the configuration parameters, Monkey Agents scan, propagate and simulate an attacker's behavior on the local network. All of the
information gathered about the network is aggregated in the Island Server and displayed once all Monkey Agents are finished.

## Results

The results of running Monkey Agents are:
 - A map displaying how much of the network an attacker can see, what services are accessible and potential propagation routes.
 - A security report, displaying security issues that Monkey Agents discovered and/or exploited.
 - A MITRE ATT&CK report, displaying the information about the ATT&CK techniques that Monkey Agents tried to use.
 - A Zero Trust report, displaying violations of Zero Trust principles that Monkey Agents found.

A more in-depth description of reports generated can be found in the [reports documentation page]({{< ref "/reports" >}}).
